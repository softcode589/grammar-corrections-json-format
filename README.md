## Format
Let's explain the format of the json files.

**What are the properties and values used for?**

- properties are the spelling mistakes
- values are the fixes

So assuming we have a json file with that criteria here is it:

```json
{
  "acceppt": "accept"
 }
```

You could see that `acceppt` (the property name) is spelled incorrectly.  
You could also see that `accept` (the value) is spelled correctly.
